Osmosis

Applications:
• Why do you place a swollen ankle in epsom salt?
• How does the kidney purify the blood?
• How does an RO water purifier work?

Diffusion:
The net movement of anything
from a region of higher concentration
to a region of lower concentration

Osmosis:
Process by which solvent moves from
a region of low solute conc. to
a region of high solute conc.
through a semi-permeable membrane

In terms of the solvent,
from region of high potential
to low potential

• Hypotonic
• Isotonic
• Hypertonic

Osmotic pressure:
external pressure applied to
a solution that prevents
the passage of solvent into it
through a s.p. membrane

O.P. is directly propotional
to the solute conc.
(of solutes that cant cross
the s.p. membrane)
