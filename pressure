What is pressure?

Pressure is the force
per unit surface area.

# normal force - mag of force scalar qty

SI unit is  Pascal (Pa)

Fluid Pressure

What are fluids?

Fluids are substances
that can flow

Origin of fluid pressure

Pressure in a fluid
P = hdg
  h = height of column
  d = density
  g = accelertion due to gravity

Applications in Human Body

• Pressure in body cavities
• Circulation of blood
• Breathing


Pascals Law

Pascal's law states that -
“Any change of pressure
applied at any point
in an enclosed fluid at rest
is transmitted undiminished
and uniformly to all its parts.”

Atmospheric Pressure

Pressure in flowing fluids

An important requirement for
flow of fluids in a system
is pressure gradient


Fluid flows from a region
of higher pressure
to that of lower pressure.”


The flow of fluid through
an orifice depends on:
 • Area of the orifice:
 • The pressure gradient:

Gas Laws

Boyle's Law
Charles Law
Daltons Law

Applications of Atmoshperic Pressure

Applications of Pascals Law


What is osmosis?

#Osmosis:
The process by which solvent
moves from a region of
lesser concentration of solutes
to higher concentration of solutes
through a semipermeable
membrane

Osmotic Pressure

Osmotic pressure maybe defined
as the external pressure that
must be applied to a solution
in order to prevent the passage of
the solvent into it
