Vocalisation

Normal breathing,
the vocal cords are relaxed and
air can pass easily through the larynx.

A voiced sound is produced when
the cords close off the larynx.

As air is exhaled,
pressure builds up behind the cords
and escapes through them.
This reduces the pressure in the back
of the cords.

When the pressure is reduced,
the cords again close,
the pressure again increases and
the action is repeated.

The character of the voice
is influenced by
• the tension, thickness
and size of the cords
• as well as the size and shape
of the throat, thorax
and para nasal sinuses.

• This explains why the frequency
of sounds is higher in women
• Change of voice happens in adolescence

Hearing

Doppler Effect

“The apparent change in frequency of sound
due to relative motion between the source
of sound and the listener is known as Doppler
effect.”

Doppler effect in daily life
• Change in sound of a train or ambulance
• Speed guns used by police
• Doppler effect in light used by astronomers
• Doppler scans in hospitals

Ultrasonic sound

Ultrasonic sound is sound of a frequency
beyond the highest value in the range of
human audibility

Carries energy that can be absorbed by the medium


Applications:
• Shatter gallstones
• Pulversize cancerous tissues

Ultrasound diathermy
•  intensities of 10^3 to 10^4 W/m2
•  applied to injured or overworked muscles
 to relieve pain and improve flexibility.
 “bone burns” and other tissue damage caused by overheating and cavitation,

When used for imaging, ultrasonic waves are emitted from a transducer, a crystal exhibiting the piezoelectric effect (the expansion and contraction of a substance when a voltage is applied across it, causing a vibration of the crystal). These high-frequency vibrations are transmitted into any tissue in contact with the transducer. Similarly, if a pressure is applied to the crystal (in the form of a wave reflected off tissue layers), a voltage is produced which can be recorded. The crystal therefore acts as both a transmitter and a receiver of sound. Ultrasound is also partially absorbed by tissue on its path, both on its journey away from the transducer and on its return journey. From the time between when the original signal is sent and when the reflections from various boundaries between media are received, (as well as a measure of the intensity loss of the signal), the nature and position of each boundary between tissues and organs may be deduced.
