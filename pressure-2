Blood pressure


• Heart consists of two pumps
• Right side forces blood through lungs
• Left causes blood to flow through rest of body.
• Right-heart failure, results in  rise in pressure
in vena cavae and  drop in pressure in arteries to the lungs.
• Left-heart failure results in a rise in pressure entering
the left side of the heart and a drop in aortal pressure.

• Control of high bp has lead to significant decrease in
hear attack and stroke fatalities.
• Typical values of systolic and diastolic pressure of
120mm Hg and 80mm Hg.
• Systolic pressure chronically high results in increased
risk of stroke and heart attack
• If low, results in fainting
• Increase in systolic pressure during exercise produces
no ill effects and maybe beneficial to tone of circulatory system.
• Diastolic pressure when low may indicate internal haemorrhage.
• High diastolic pressure indicates ballooning of vessels.
• Also indicates that vessels are not dialting properly which can
strain the heart when pumping the blood.

• B.P. decreases from 120mm to almost 0 as it goes from
aorta to smaller arteries to small veins.
• The differences in pressure due to blood flow through system
as well as the position of the person.
• For a person standing up the pressure in feet larger than
at the heart due to weight of blood (difference of 108mm Hg).
• Standing long time can lead to accumulation
of blood in the legs and swelling.
• Elastic bangages around the calf provide increased pressure
to enable veins to send blood back to the heart.


Arterial Pressure
It represents the force exerted by the blood
per unit area on the arterial wall and is
the sum of hemodynamic, kinetic,
and hydrostatic pressure.

• Hemodyanamic: Due to energy imparted by the
contraction of the left ventricle
• Kinetic:  Due to the energy of motion
• Hyrostatic: Due to fluid density and gravity

• Blood pressure may aslo be measure in the major veins,
the heart chambers, the arteries to the brain and lungs.
• Are only monitored during surgery since they are invasive.
• Thin tubes called catheters are threaded into these places
to transmit pressure to external measuring devices.

Central Venous Pressure:
The pressure measured in the central
veins close to the heart.

Intraocular Pressure
• Maintains the shape of the eye
• Normal range 12 - 24 mm Hg
• Build up in pressure leads to glaucoma
• Pressure as high as 85mm Hg can lead to
permanent damage of optic nerve

Measuring Intraocular pressure:
• Measurements involve exerting a force on the
anesthetized eye over some area and observing
the eyes response.
• Non contact approach uses a puff of air to
measure the force needed to indent the eye.
• If the I.O. pressure is high, the eye will deform less
and rebound more vigrourously than normal.
